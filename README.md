# Challenge 1: Code Refactor for Horiseon Website

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with refactoring the codebase for a marketing agency called Horiseon. 

## Work completed

I fixed the semantic HTML elements so they follow a logical structure and made the webpage meet accessibility standards and better SEO practices. I also fixed broken internal links and removed uncessary CSS classes. Added alt attributes to images.
